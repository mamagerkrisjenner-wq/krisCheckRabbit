    - path: '**/*.tsx'
      instructions: |
        - Ensure files have less than 100 lines not include imports and exports
        - Ensure function are less then 30 lines
        - Ensure variables are declared with const or let; never use var
        - Ensure all imports are at the top of the file
        - Ensure efficient code structure and organization
        - Avoid duplicate imports from the same module; consolidate them into a single import statement
        - Avoid unused imports; remove any imports that are not used in the file
        - Avoid duplicate code; refactor repeated code into reusable functions or components
        - All variables, parameters, and return types must have explicit types; never use 'any' type
        - Use ternary operator when assigning values to variables; use if/else for other logic
        - Ternary conditions must be on a single line
        - Only use arrow functions
        - Use functional components only; never use React.createClass or React.Component
        - Component props must have TypeScript types defined
        - Use camelCase for variable and function names
        - Each component must be in a separate file
        - File name must match the component name
        - Use single quotes (') instead of double quotes (")
        - Never use array index as key in lists
        - Never use anonymous functions; always name functions
        - Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and components
        - All hardcoded strings and numbers must be extracted to constants (e.g., const HELLO = 'hello'; <h>{HELLO}</h>)
        - All colors must be in rgb() or rgba() format (rgba only if transparency needed) and defined in a separate colors file
    - path: '**/*.ts'
